This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and explores
various techniques to enhance model performance. The study utilizes the CINIC-10 dataset, an
augmented extension of CIFAR-10, comprising 270,000 images equally divided into training, validation,
and test subsets. Each subset contains 90,000 images across ten classes, identical to those in CIFAR-10,
providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating image classification models.
The project aims to compare different network architectures, investigate hyper-parameter influences,
apply data augmentation techniques, implement few-shot learning methods, evaluate training set reduc-
tion impact and explore ensemble methods. For
the purpose of model comparison, averaged metrics were used: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score,
along with their standard deviation.
